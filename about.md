title: The Dev Behind the Beard

![A Picture of Me (and my beard)](/assets/images/pages/about.jpg){: .image-right}
My name is Paul Aly. I'm a software developer, mentor, and all around tech enthusiast. I currently work at BTI360, a mid-sized software firm headquartered in Ashburn, Virginia, **however this blog, its contents, and opinions are my own**. 

Continuous learning is one of my passions, and I thought this blog would be a great way I could do that while also sharing my experiences with others. I created LumberjackDev with a few goals in mind:
1. Help others learn as they begin their software development careers
1. Provide insights into what it's like to learn new things
1. Record solutions to (un)common problems

#### Interests
Outside of software development and growing my beard, my interests include reading fantasy novels (I'm a huge fan of Steven Erikson and Brandon Sanderson), weightlifting, and watching Good Mythical Morning.

#### Background
In my career, I've worked primarily as a Java developer specializing in the Spring ecosystem. However, I do like to view myself as a generalist when it comes to technologies. Most of the projects I have worked on have been building RESTful APIs. Lately, I've been really into building more powerful APIs using [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS). 

As far as education goes, I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. More recently I completed my Master's in Computer Science from John Hopkins.

#### The Beard
For those curious, the beard has been going strong since June 2018. There are currently no plans to limit its growth, so it will keep growing for the forseeable future.
