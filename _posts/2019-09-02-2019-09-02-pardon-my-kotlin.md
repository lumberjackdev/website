If you read the [last post]({% post_url 2019-08-29-spring-caching %}) (and if not, then go check it out!), you may have noticed that the example code is all written in Kotlin. I even used Kotlin for the [buildscript](https://github.com/lumberjackdev/spring-caching-with-multiple-providers/blob/master/build.gradle.kts)! I did this for several reasons, and that's what I want to discuss with this post.

### Why Kotlin?
Anyone who's worked with me will tell you I make no effort to hide my appreciation for Kotlin. It wasn't always this way, however, before it was Scala that held my obsession. I first started learning Kotlin a little over a year ago. I was working on [example project](https://github.com/maly7/spring-boot-microservices) to learn several new-to-me technologies: kubernetes, spring cloud, mongodb, etc. While I was working on the application code for the project, I realized that I was getting a little bored of writing everything in Java, so I decided to have some more fun and throw Kotlin into the mix. 

For the majority of my posts about Spring, I'll probably be using Kotlin.

- New experience for anyone familiar with Java and other JVM languages
- Excellent [Spring support](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-kotlin.html)
- Kotlin is not [without issues](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-6653)

### Why learn new languages?
I didn't immediately fall in love with Kotlin, there were even a few things that lead to some frustrations. However, as I was working through the learning experience, I realized something: Writing code in a new language made me fall in love with programming all over again. I started to feel that same excitement new developers first experience upon seeing their code work. This is part of why I think it's important to learn new programming languages.

- don't like being just a "Java Developer"
- new languages mean new ways to solve problems
- engineers are lifelong learners, so learn
