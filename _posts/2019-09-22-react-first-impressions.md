summary: First Impressions of React
---

Recently my adventure into learning new technologies brought me into the world of [React](https://reactjs.org/). For those who know me, this is way outside of my technology comfort zone. I haven't touched a frontend JavaScript framework since AngularJS (no, that's not a typo. This was way before the JS was dropped from the name). 

### New JavaScript Features
- Feels like learning a new language because so much has changed
- Can be hard to distinguish between what's React and what's a new JavaScript feature
- Link to an article explaining all the different types of JS
- List some cool features

### Components
- Components are the key part of React
- Seems like most of the time will be spent writing components

### JSX
- Seems weird at first
- It grew on me because it's easier to keep everything together
- Function components are neat

### State
If you ask anyone, managing application state is hard. Really hard. **Insert a bunch of links in this section**
- Lifting state up
- Immutability seems to be preferred

### What's Next

One of the import parts of React that I didn't get into was [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). I feel like there's so much to talk about with Hooks, that I'll probably right a follow on post about them.

- Building an example app in React
