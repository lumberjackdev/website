Recently my adventure into learning new technologies brought me into the world of [React](https://reactjs.org/). For those who know me, this is way outside of my technology comfort zone. I haven't touched a frontend JavaScript framework since AngularJS (no, that's not a typo. It was way before the JS was dropped from the name). Most of my impressions are based on the [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and reading a few blog posts. 

### New JavaScript Features
- Feels like learning a new language because so much has changed
- Can be hard to distinguish between what's React and what's a new JavaScript feature
- [Link](https://benmccormick.org/2015/09/14/es5-es6-es2016-es-next-whats-going-on-with-javascript-versioning) to an article explaining all the different types of JS
- List some cool features

### Components
- Components are the key part of React
- Seems like most of the time will be spent writing components

### JSX
- Seems weird at first
- It grew on me because it's easier to keep everything together
- The more I used it, the more natural it felt
- Function components are neat

### State
If you ask anyone, managing application state is hard. Really hard. **Insert a bunch of links in this section**
- Lifting state up
- Immutability seems to be preferred

### What's Next
All in all, I had fun beginning my way back into frontend development. What I noticed is that I worked through the tutorial, I wanted more. I took it as a sure sign for me that I was going to enjoy React. It's a similar feeling when I'm learning any technology that I enjoy. So there will definitely be future posts on React. 

One of the import parts of React that I didn't get into was [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). I feel like there's so much to talk about with Hooks, that I'll probably right a follow on post about them. 

I talked briefly about some of the new JavaScript features I enjoyed, so I think it's worth mentioning that I'll most likely go into TypeScript from here. I have a hunch that the type safety and other features of the language will feel more like home for me. 

From here my goal is to get comfortable enough with React that it can become part of my regular toolbox of technologies. I'll be writing an example app or two to help accomplish my goal, and that means writing about the experience as well.

I'm going to experiment by creating a series of sorts by updating the post with links to follow on posts in the future. That's all for now though, thanks for reading!
