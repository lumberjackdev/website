### The Problem
In most cases with a Spring Boot app, you'll likely only ever have one cache provider. Spring Boot provides [quite a few](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-caching.html#boot-features-caching-provider) cache providers out of the box. But what happens if you want to use multiple providers in your application? I'll be exploring some potential solutions to this problem in today's post.

### The Solution

### Things to Look Out For
If you're migrating from previously having only one provider to multiple providers, then you may have specified the application property `spring.cache.type` in order to force the usage of a specific cache type. When combining multiple providers, you'll want to avoid that. 

Check out the example code on [github](https://github.com/lumberjackdev/spring-caching-with-multiple-providers) if you'd like to see the complete example!
