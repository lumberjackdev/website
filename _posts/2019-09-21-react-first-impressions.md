summary: First Impressions of React
---

Recently my adventure into learning new technologies brought me into the world of [React](https://reactjs.org/). For those who know me, this is way outside of my technology comfort zone. I haven't touched a frontend JavaScript framework since AngularJS (no, that's not a typo. This was way before the JS was dropped from the name). Most of my impressions are based on the [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and reading a few blog posts. 

### New JavaScript Features
- Feels like learning a new language because so much has changed
- Can be hard to distinguish between what's React and what's a new JavaScript feature
- Link to an article explaining all the different types of JS
- List some cool features

### Components
- Components are the key part of React
- Seems like most of the time will be spent writing components

### JSX
- Seems weird at first
- It grew on me because it's easier to keep everything together
- The more I used it, the more natural it felt
- Function components are neat

### State
If you ask anyone, managing application state is hard. Really hard. **Insert a bunch of links in this section**
- Lifting state up
- Immutability seems to be preferred

### What's Next
All in all, I had fun beginning my way back into frontend development. What I noticed is that I worked through the tutorial, I wanted more. This was a sure sign for me that I was going to enjoy React. It's a similar feeling when I'm learning any technology that I enjoy. So there will definitely be future posts on React. 

One of the import parts of React that I didn't get into was [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). I feel like there's so much to talk about with Hooks, that I'll probably right a follow on post about them. 

I talked briefly about some of the new JavaScript features I enjoyed during this process, so I think it's worth mentioning that I'll most likely go into TypeScript from here. I have a hunch that the type safety and other features of the language will feel more like home for me.
